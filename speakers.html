        <h3 class="speaker-name">Himanshu Chakrawarti</h3>
        <span class="speaker-designation">CEO, Stellaro Brands</span>
        <p class="speaker-bio">Himanshu Chakrawarti aka Chako or Chakoni is a Metallurgical Engineer from IIT-Kanpur. A good jammer in Hindi and English, this Marketing Man of IIT’s D-Block secured a Lakme job (Marketing) - after majoring in Finance. He spent the first 9 years of life with Lakmé (HUL) and then joined Heinz. Then he met Mr. Noel Tata in September 2000. Mr. Tata offered him an opportunity to work in retail and even though everyone wasn’t sure of the shift, something instinctive inside of Himanshu made him take it up. That was the beginning of his love affair with Retail- when he joined Westside. He then went out of retail for 4-5 years only to join back because he found it challenging and interesting. His key learnings were to focus on the product and customer experience. And lastly, that there are no magic bullets, just steady progress that gets you where you want to reach.</p>
